### General Sales & Typed Sales Reports

These are two group by queries that need to be joined
on fields that are not foreign keys. 

The General Sales report joins a view to a 
reporting category table, but only to the "general"
category labels.

The Typed Sales report joins a view to a 
reporting category table, but it joins on category
and order type.
